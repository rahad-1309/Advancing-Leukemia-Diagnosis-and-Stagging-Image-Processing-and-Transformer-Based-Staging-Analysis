# Advancing-Leukemia-Diagnosis-and-Stagging-Image-Processing-and-Transformer-Based-Staging-Analysis
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells, and early diagnosis and accurate staging are crucial for effective treatment. By integrating image processing techniques with transformer-based models, this project aims to improve the precision and reliability of leukemia diagnosis.
